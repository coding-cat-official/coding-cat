# Welcome to Coding Cat

In browser IDE and tester for python. For educational purposes, inspired by [Coding
bad](https://www.codingbat.com).

### TO DO

Future features we'd like to add:

- User accounts with log ins, persistent solutions, tracks progress
- Debugger? Ability to test code in a REPL?
- Choose your own inputs to the functions
- Partially hidden tests
- Print statements

### BUGS

- In `intersecting_metro`, if you do `return None` this somehow triggers the timeout.
